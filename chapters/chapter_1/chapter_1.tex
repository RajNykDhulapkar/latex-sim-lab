\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}

A single phase half wave uncontrolled rectifier circuit consists of an AC source, a diode, and a load. During the positive half cycle of the AC voltage, the diode is forward biased and conducts, allowing the current to flow through the load. During the negative half cycle, the diode becomes reverse biased and blocks the current flow. The output voltage of the circuit is unidirectional and pulsating. This circuit is used in applications where a low cost and simple design are important factors, such as in power supplies for household appliances.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30â—¦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

By leveraging MATLAB's Simulink, the study successfully implemented single-phase half-wave rectifiers - both controlled and uncontrolled - employing various loads, including resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive, and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode. Subsequently, the simulation facilitated the extraction of output waveforms for voltage and current, allowing for a comparative analysis of theoretically calculated and simulated output parameters. Efficiency measurements were further taken for half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, resulting in efficiency values of 40.34\%, 41.66\%, 44.13\%, and 58.88\%, respectively. The investigation yielded a conclusion that the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load possessed the highest efficiency of 58.88\%. Efficiency measurements were also conducted for half-wave controlled rectifiers on R load, RL load, and RLE load, delivering efficiency values of 35.95\%, 37.99\%, and 58.18\%, respectively. Consequently, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load achieved the highest efficiency of 58.18\%.

The present experiment effectively utilized MATLAB's Simulink to implement single-phase half-wave rectifiers - both controlled and uncontrolled - with various loads including resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive, and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode. The resulting simulation enabled the derivation of output waveforms for voltage and current, allowing for a comparative assessment of theoretical versus simulated output parameters. Additionally, efficiency measurements were conducted for half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, resulting in respective efficiency values of 40.34\%, 41.66\%, 44.13\%, and 58.88\%. The experiment established the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load as possessing maximum efficiency of 58.88\%. The efficiency measurements were similarly conducted for half-wave controlled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, and RLE load, resulting in efficiency values of 35.95\%, 37.99\%, and 58.18\%, respectively. Thus, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load exhibited the highest efficiency of 58.18\%.

\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}

In a half wave rectifier circuit, the diode is placed in series with the load. When the AC voltage is positive, the diode is forward biased and conducts, allowing the current to flow through the load in the forward direction. During the negative half cycle, the diode becomes reverse biased and blocks the current flow. As a result, the load receives pulsating DC voltage with only one polarity. The output voltage of the half wave rectifier is not continuous and has a large amount of ripple. This circuit is used in low-power applications where cost and simplicity are important factors.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30â—¦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

In this experiment, the implementation of single-phase half-wave rectifiers, both controlled and uncontrolled, with resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode loads were successfully accomplished using MATLAB's Simulink. The output waveforms for voltage and current were obtained in each case, and a comparative analysis between theoretically calculated and simulated output parameters was also performed.

Efficiency measurements were conducted on the half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers with R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, yielding efficiency values of 44.84\%, 43.84\%, 44.8\%, and 67.88\%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.88\%. Similarly, the efficiency values of half-wave controlled rectifiers with R load, RL load, and RLE load were measured as 41.86\%, 40.85\%, 44.8\%, and 67.43\%, respectively. Thus, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.43\%.

Overall, the simulation results provided a clear indication of the efficiency of each type of rectifier with different loads. These results can be used as a guide to select the appropriate type of rectifier for a specific load in real-world applications. The implementation of these rectifiers has great practical significance in power electronics and can be used in a variety of applications, such as power supplies, motor drives, and lighting systems.

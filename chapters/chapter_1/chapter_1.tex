\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}
A rectifier is a device that converts alternating current (AC) to direct
current (DC). It is done by using a diode or a group of diodes.
A half wave rectifier is defined as a type of rectifier that only allows
one half-cycle of an AC voltage waveform to pass, blocking the other
half-cycle. Half-wave rectifiers are used to convert AC voltage to DC
voltage, and only require a single diode to construct.

\hspace{\parindent}
\textbf{Single Phase Half Wave Uncontrolled Rectifier:}
This rectifier comprises of an AC source, a diode and a load. The
diode gets forward biased during the positive half cycle of the AC
source, and the circuit conducts. During the negative half cycle, the
diode becomes reverse biased and blocks current.

\hspace{\parindent}
\textbf{Single Phase Half Wave Controlled Rectifier:}
This rectifier comprises of an AC source, a Thyristor/SCR and a
load. The key difference here, is the presence of the thyristor/SCR,
which conducts only when gate pulses at a firing angle $ \alpha $ are applied
to it. The SCR automatically turns off when its voltage is reverse
biased for a period longer than the SCR turn off time and its current
falls below holding current.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
For an R load, average output voltage and current for a controlled
half wave rectifier are given by:

$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

Where $ \alpha $ is the firing angle of the thyristor. For uncontrolled recti-
fiers, the thyristor is replaced by a diode, and $ \alpha $ = 0.

\section{Results}
%------------SUB----------RESULTS---------------------------
\subsection{Theoretical Calculation}


\hspace{1.5cm} The resistance \textbf{R} in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.2 is considered as 20 $\Omega$, and the voltage (which is effectively the voltage across \textbf{R}) is considered as 50 V, 100 V, 150 V and 200 V in four steps as mentioned in the second column of Table-\ref{Table_simulation-result}. As per \textbf{Ohm's Law}, the current corresponding to all the four voltages are,
$$I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{50}{20}= 2.5~A~~ (for~ V =50 V);~~~   = 5~A~~ (for~ V =100 V);~~~
    = 7.5~A~~ (for~ V =150 V);~~~= 10~A~~ (for~ V =200 V) $$

\subsection{Simulation Results}
\hspace{1.5cm} The simulink file is run for 10 sec considering V=50 V, and and corresponding current seen in the display is noted in the fourth column of second row of Table-\ref{Table_simulation-result}. Similarly, all other three rows are filled.  Further, constantly varying ramp voltage is applied and the corresponding \textit{v-i} graph is plotted in Fig. \ref{Fig_v-i graph}.

\section{Conclusion}
\hspace{\parindent}
The design of single phase half wave rectifiers, both controlled and
uncontrolled, with R, RL, RL with freewheeling diode, and RLE
loads were implemented successfully in MATLAB using Simulink.
The output waveforms for voltage and current were obtained in each
case, and a comparison between theoretically calculated and simu-
lated output parameter values was also performed.

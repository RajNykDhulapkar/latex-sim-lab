\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}

In a half wave rectifier, the diode is used to rectify the AC voltage into pulsating DC voltage. The diode is connected in series with the load, which allows only the positive half cycle of the AC waveform to pass through. During the negative half cycle, the diode becomes reverse biased and blocks the current flow. The output voltage of the rectifier is a pulsating DC voltage with only one polarity, which contains a large amount of ripple. The peak-to-peak voltage ripple of the output voltage is equal to the input voltage multiplied by 0.707. The half wave rectifier is simple and inexpensive, but it has a low efficiency and high ripple factor, which limits its applications to low-power and low-cost circuits

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30◦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

In this experiment, the implementation of single-phase half-wave rectifiers, both controlled and uncontrolled, with resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode loads were successfully accomplished using MATLAB's Simulink. The output waveforms for voltage and current were obtained in each case, and a comparative analysis between theoretically calculated and simulated output parameters was also performed.

Efficiency measurements were conducted on the half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers with R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, yielding efficiency values of 44.84\%, 43.84\%, 44.8\%, and 67.88\%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.88\%. Similarly, the efficiency values of half-wave controlled rectifiers with R load, RL load, and RLE load were measured as 41.86\%, 40.85\%, 44.8\%, and 67.43\%, respectively. Thus, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.43\%.

Overall, the simulation results provided a clear indication of the efficiency of each type of rectifier with different loads. These results can be used as a guide to select the appropriate type of rectifier for a specific load in real-world applications. The implementation of these rectifiers has great practical significance in power electronics and can be used in a variety of applications, such as power supplies, motor drives, and lighting systems.

In a half wave rectifier, the diode is used to rectify the AC voltage into pulsating DC voltage. The diode is connected in series with the load, which allows only the positive half cycle of the AC waveform to pass through. During the negative half cycle, the diode becomes reverse biased and blocks the current flow. The output voltage of the rectifier is a pulsating DC voltage with only one polarity, which contains a large amount of ripple. The peak-to-peak voltage ripple of the output voltage is equal to the input voltage multiplied by 0.707. The half wave rectifier is simple and inexpensive, but it has a low efficiency and high ripple factor, which limits its applications to low-power and low-cost circuits

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30â—¦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

The experimental design employed MATLAB's Simulink to effectually implement single-phase half-wave rectifiers - both controlled and uncontrolled - with varying loads including resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive, and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode. The ensuing simulation enabled waveform extraction for voltage and current, allowing for a comparative analysis of theoretical versus simulated output parameters. The assessment further entailed efficiency measurements for half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, culminating in respective efficiency values of 40.34\%, 41.66\%, 44.13\%, and 58.88\%. The experiment confirmed the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load attaining maximum efficiency of 58.88\%. Correspondingly, efficiency measurements of half-wave controlled rectifiers on R load, RL load, and RLE load were conducted, yielding efficiency values of 35.95\%, 37.99\%, and 58.18\%, respectively. Hence, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load obtained the highest efficiency of 58.18\%, as per the evaluation.

\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}

The operation of a half wave rectifier is simple and straightforward. A diode is used to block one half of the AC waveform, allowing only the positive half to pass through. This results in a DC output voltage that is roughly equal to the peak value of the AC waveform, minus the voltage drop across the diode. The output voltage of a half wave rectifier is not constant, but varies with time. This is due to the pulsating nature of the DC voltage, which has a large amount of ripple. Despite its simplicity, the half wave rectifier is still widely used in low-power applications, such as battery chargers and small power supplies.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30â—¦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

In this experiment, the implementation of single-phase half-wave rectifiers, both controlled and uncontrolled, with resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode loads were successfully accomplished using MATLAB's Simulink. The output waveforms for voltage and current were obtained in each case, and a comparative analysis between theoretically calculated and simulated output parameters was also performed.

Efficiency measurements were conducted on the half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers with R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, yielding efficiency values of 44.84\%, 43.84\%, 44.8\%, and 67.88\%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.88\%. Similarly, the efficiency values of half-wave controlled rectifiers with R load, RL load, and RLE load were measured as 41.86\%, 40.85\%, 44.8\%, and 67.43\%, respectively. Thus, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load has the maximum efficiency of 67.43\%.

Overall, the simulation results provided a clear indication of the efficiency of each type of rectifier with different loads. These results can be used as a guide to select the appropriate type of rectifier for a specific load in real-world applications. The implementation of these rectifiers has great practical significance in power electronics and can be used in a variety of applications, such as power supplies, motor drives, and lighting systems.

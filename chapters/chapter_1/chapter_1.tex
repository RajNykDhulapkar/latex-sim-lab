\section{Theory}
\hspace{\parindent}

A single phase half wave controlled rectifier circuit consists of an AC source, a thyristor, and a load. The thyristor conducts only when a gate pulse is applied to it, triggering it into the conducting state. The triggering angle (alpha) determines when the thyristor conducts, which allows the output voltage to be controlled. When the voltage across the thyristor becomes negative, it automatically turns off, and the circuit returns to a non-conducting state. This type of rectifier is widely used in applications that require precise control of the output voltage, such as in motor speed controllers and AC/DC converters.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
The theoretical calculations for a half-wave rectifier with an R load are given by the formulas:


$$
    V_{o,avg} =
    V_{phase}
    \sqrt{2(1 + cos\alpha)2\pi} =
    V_m(1 + cos\alpha)
    2\pi
$$
$$
    I_{o,avg} =
    V_oR
$$

In uncontrolled rectifiers, $ \alpha$ = 0, and the thyristor is replaced with a diode.
For a single-phase half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $,
the output voltage is 103.53V, and the output current is 10.53A.

For a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier with an RMS voltage of 230V
and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $ and a firing angle of $ \alpha  $ = 30â—¦, the output voltage
is 96.6V, and the output current is 9.66A.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

The present experiment effectively utilized MATLAB's Simulink to implement single-phase half-wave rectifiers - both controlled and uncontrolled - with various loads including resistive, inductive, resistive-inductive, and resistive-inductive with freewheeling diode. The resulting simulation enabled the derivation of output waveforms for voltage and current, allowing for a comparative assessment of theoretical versus simulated output parameters. Additionally, efficiency measurements were conducted for half-wave uncontrolled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, RL load with freewheeling diode, and RLE load, resulting in respective efficiency values of 40.34\%, 41.66\%, 44.13\%, and 58.88\%. The experiment established the half-wave uncontrolled rectifier with RLE load as possessing maximum efficiency of 58.88\%. The efficiency measurements were similarly conducted for half-wave controlled rectifiers operating on R load, RL load, and RLE load, resulting in efficiency values of 35.95\%, 37.99\%, and 58.18\%, respectively. Thus, the half-wave controlled rectifier with RLE load exhibited the highest efficiency of 58.18\%.

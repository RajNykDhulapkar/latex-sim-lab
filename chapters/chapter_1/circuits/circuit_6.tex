Upon providing the firing gate pulse to the thyristor, it is observed that the circuit begins conducting. Due to the presence of an inductive component in the load, the output current lags behind the output voltage, leading to the conduction of the diode until the output current approaches zero. Consequently, the output voltage becomes negative during this duration. After the output current falls to zero, the thyristor ceases conduction, and the output voltage returns to zero as well.
Additionally, the DC output power was estimated to be 872.3W, while the AC input power was found to be 2296W, resulting in an overall efficiency of 37.99\%.

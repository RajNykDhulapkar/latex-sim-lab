Upon observation, it is discerned that the simulated values coincide precisely with the corresponding theoretical values. Owing to the resistive nature of the load, the output current is in phase with the output voltage. Analysis of the output voltage and current waveforms reveals that the diode conducts during the positive half-cycle of the AC source, while it becomes reverse-biased during the negative half-cycle.
Additionally, the DC output power was estimated to be 1063W, while the AC input power was found to be 2636W, resulting in an overall efficiency of 40.34\%.

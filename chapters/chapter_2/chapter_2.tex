A full-wave rectifier is an electronic circuit that converts an alternating current (AC) input signal into a unidirectional pulsating direct current (DC) output signal. It is a rectifier that uses both halves of the input sinusoidal waveform. It is essentially two half-wave rectifiers connected together to feed the load. The rectification is done by passing the positive half of the waveform while inverting the negative half of the sine wave. This results in a pulsating DC output. However, the output does not reverse direction, as it uses the full 100% of the input waveform, resulting in full-wave rectification.

The full-wave rectifier is a more efficient rectifier compared to the half-wave rectifier because it produces a smoother DC output. Additionally, it has a higher output voltage and lower output ripple than a half-wave rectifier.

In a single-phase full-wave rectifier, four diodes are used in a bridge configuration to rectify the AC input signal. The input AC voltage is applied across the two AC input terminals of the rectifier, and the output voltage is taken from the two DC output terminals. The four diodes are connected in such a way that the input voltage is rectified, producing a DC output voltage across the output terminals.

The four diodes used in the bridge rectifier are arranged in a way such that when the AC input voltage is positive, diodes D1 and D3 are forward-biased and conduct, while diodes D2 and D4 are reverse-biased and do not conduct. Conversely, when the AC input voltage is negative, diodes D2 and D4 are forward-biased and conduct, while diodes D1 and D3 are reverse-biased and do not conduct. This process of rectification occurs for each half-cycle of the AC input voltage, producing a unidirectional DC output signal.

\section{Theoretical Calculations}
\hspace{\parindent}
In the theory of full-wave rectifiers, the average output voltage and current for controlled full-wave rectifiers with resistive (R) load can be calculated using the following equations:

\begin{equation}
    V_{o,avg}
    = \frac{V_{phase}\sqrt{2}(1+\cos\alpha)}{\pi}
    = \frac{V_m(1+\cos\alpha)}{\pi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    I_{o,avg} = \frac{V_{o,avg}}{R}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the thyristor's firing angle. It should be noted that in uncontrolled rectifiers, the thyristor is switched out for a diode and $\alpha$ is equal to 0.

Consider an AC source with an RMS voltage of 230V and a resistive load of 10$ \Omega $. The output voltage and current for a single phase full-wave uncontrolled rectifier are given by:
\begin{align}
    V_{0} = 207.07V \hspace{1cm}   I_{0} = 20.70A
\end{align}

The output voltage and current for a single phase full-wave controlled rectifier (Firing Angle = 30$ ^\circ $) are given by:

\vspace{-0.5cm}

\begin{align}
    V_{0} = 193.2V \hspace{1cm}   I_{0} = 19.32A
\end{align}

% Similarly, for a single phase half-wave controlled rectifier with a firing angle of $ \alpha $  = 30, the output voltage and current are given by:

% \begin{align}
%     V_{0} & = 193.2\mathrm{V} \\
%     I_{0} & = 19.32\mathrm{A}
% \end{align}

% The DC power output for a single phase full-wave uncontrolled rectifier is found to be 4173.849W, while for a single phase full-wave controlled rectifier with a firing angle of $ \alpha $ = 30, the DC power output is 3638.554W.

\section{Conclusion}


\hspace{\parindent}

Utilizing the MATLAB Simulink platform, the design of single phase full wave rectifiers with both controlled and uncontrolled R and RL loads was carried out with remarkable success. Voltage and current output waveforms were attained and output parameter values, both theoretically calculated and simulated, were juxtaposed.
The full-wave uncontrolled rectifier's efficiencies with R and RL load are measured to be 89.32\%. Furthermore, the full-wave controlled rectifier's efficiencies with R and RL load were measured to be 83.41\% and 81.33\%, respectively.

In conclusion, the full-wave rectifier is a more efficient and practical alternative to the half-wave rectifier because it produces a smoother DC output, has a higher output voltage and lower output ripple. The four diodes used in a bridge configuration ensure that the input AC voltage is rectified, producing a DC output voltage across the output terminals.
This process of rectification produces a unidirectional DC output signal that can be used for various applications.
The average output voltage and current for full-wave rectifiers with R load can be calculated using the above equations. It is important to note that these calculations are based on idealized conditions and practical circuits may have additional factors that affect their performance.
